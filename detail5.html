							<h2>Cersei Lannister</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Cersei Lannister, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, is the wife of King Robert Baratheon. Her father arranged the marriage, after his attempt to betroth her to Rhaegar Targaryen as she wanted failed and Targaryen dynasty lost the war, initiating himself as a political counselor for the newly crowned King Robert. The Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros and helped him to win the Throne, which is why Robert was interested in a marriage between them. Cersei has a twin brother, Jaime, with whom she has been involved in an incestuous affair. All three of Cersei's children are Jaime's. Cersei's main character attribute is her desire for power and her ambition.
</p>
						<p>Cersei is born as the only daughter and first child of Tywin Lannister and his wife Joanna, with her twin brother Jaime born soon after. Cersei and Jaime looked so similar as children, that Cersei occasionally wore Jaimeâ€™s clothes and was mistaken for him.They even went as far as to experiment together in a sexual manner at an early age but they were discovered by a servant who informed their mother. She decided to separate them using a guard and to keep this a secret from their father, threatening them that she would inform him in case they repeat it. Soon after her mother died giving birth to their dwarf brother Tyrion, Cersei blamed Tyrion for her death, and started to abuse him as a baby.
