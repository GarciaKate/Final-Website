					<p> Margaery has thick, softly curling brown hair, large brown eyes, a pale, smooth unblemished skin, and a slender, but womanly figure. She is fair and lively, with a shy and sweet smile. She is regarded as beautiful or pretty by most. Tyrion Lannister considers her to be just as comely as Sansa Stark. Both Sansa and Cersei Lannister note the similarities in appearance between Margaery and her youngest brother, Loras. According to Cersei, Margaery and Loras look more alike than Cersei and her twin, Jaime. According to Renly Baratheon, there are people who claim Margaery looks like Lyanna Stark.</p>
					<p> Margaery is intelligent and shrewed, and takes after her grandmother, the cunning Lady Olenna Tyrell. Margaery is her grandmother's protégée, and as such, Olenna has made certain that Margaery is capable of protecting herself from those who might use or abuse her. Varys describes Margaery as sweet and tractable. Sansa considers Margaery to be sweet and gentle, while Cersei considers her to be restless, as Margaery often goes for a ride, a trip by boat, or out hawking.The generous Margaery is popular with smallfolk.
