					<p> In his childhood Jojen nearly died of greywater fever. While he was near death, he was visited by a three-eyed crow that gave him the gift of greensight, causing him to experience prophetic dreams known as greendreams. One such dream involved a chained wolf that the three-eyed crow was trying to free from a chain. When Jojen told his his father, Howland Reed, about the dream, Lord Howland sent him and his sister Meera to Winterfell.</p>
					<p> Even though he experiences greendreams, Jojen is not a Greenseer as, lacking the abilities of a warg, he cannot commune with weirwood trees.</p>

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>

The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
