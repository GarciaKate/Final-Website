							<h2>Shae</h2>
						</header>
					<p>Shae serves as a camp follower with Lord Tywin Lannister's army when Bronn brings her to Tyrion Lannister, who is looking for a female companion before the battle on the Green Fork. Tyrion sleeps with her both before and after the battle, taking a liking to her, and he decides to take her with him to King's Landing despite his father Tywin's explicit command not to take the whore to court. </p>
					<p>Upon arrival in King's Landing, Shae is set up at a house in the city. Tyrion cannot bring her to court, already defying his father in bringing her to the capital. Tyrion makes frequent use of Shae's services, relegating her to a role as his exclusive companion, and he finds his feelings for her are very strong. Tyrion believes he has finally gotten over his first wife, Tysha, and his need for whoring. </p>
					<p> Recognizing that Shae's presence in King's Landing is a weapon his adversaries could use against him, Tyrion takes pains to keep her safe and secret, though her presence is immediately known to Varys, who on several occasions facilitates their trysts. Tyrion keeps her in a manse in the city where they can rendezvous in secret.</p>
					<p>With the approach of Stannis Baratheon's army and the breaking out of several riots in the city, Tyrion comes to fear for Shae's safety and moves her to the Red Keep. He finds her a cover job as a maid of Lollys Stokeworth, allowing him to continue to see her.
