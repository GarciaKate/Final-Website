							<h2>Rodrik Cassel </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Ser Rodrik Cassel is a knight from House Cassel and a member of the Stark household. He is the uncle of Jory Cassel and the master-at-arms of Winterfell, in which capacity he trained Robb Stark, Jon Snow, and Theon Greyjoy at arms.</p>
					<p> After the discovery of the Valyrian steel knife from the attempted assassination of Bran Stark, Rodrik accompanies Lady Catelyn Stark to King's Landing. They travel by sea. The voyage is a difficult one for Rodrik, who gets seasick and has to cut his whiskers because they become so soiled from vomit.</p>
					<p> In King's Landing, Rodrik brings the Valyrian steel dagger to Ser Aron Santagar, the master-at-arms of the Red Keep, in a vain hope that he might recognize the blade. Afterwards he and Catelyn meet Petyr Baelish, who tells them that the knife that was used in the attempt on Bran was owned by Tyrion Lannister. After telling Lord Eddard Stark about the attempt on Bran, the Starks decide that Catelyn should return to Winterfell. On the way back to Winterfell, at the crossroads inn in the riverlands they meet Tyrion Lannister, who recognizes Catelyn. Because of what Baelish has told her, Catelyn holds Tyrion responsible for the attack on her son and takes the Imp prisoner.</p>
