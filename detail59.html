							<h2>Jaqen H’ghar </h2>
						</header>
					<p>Jaqen H'ghar is part of Yoren's group of recruits taken from King's Landing to join the Night's Watch, just after the execution of Eddard Stark. He is one of three prisoners found in the infamous "black cells", the dungeons reserved for only the worst criminals. The other black cells criminals, Rorge and Biter, are afraid of him.Jaqen behaves in an obsequious manner toward Arya Stark while being escorted to the Wall. When Ser Amory Lorch attacks the company at an abandoned town by the God's Eye, Arya saves him and his two fellow prisoners from death by a fire. </p>
					<p> At Harrenhal, Jaqen finds her again and tells her that she is owed three deaths and to select three people for him to kill, to repay the deaths she stole from the "Red God". Arya uses him to eliminate two of her enemies at Harrenhal, Chiswyck and Weese, but he rejects her request for aid in any other way. By threatening to select Jaqen himself as her third choice, Arya ultimately forces him to help free the northmen imprisoned at Harrenhal.</p>
					<p> Once his debt is filled, Jaqen prepares to take his leave, but he first gives Arya an old iron coin and instructs her to give it to any man of Braavos, saying the words "valar morghulis" should she ever need more help. Then he announces that "Jaqen H'ghar" must die, and passes a hand over his face. His face magically reshapes into that of a hook-nosed man with a gold tooth.</p>
