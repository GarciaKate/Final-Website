							<h2>Daario Naharis </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Daario is part of the Stormcrows when they take on a contract to defend Yunkai from the forces of Daenerys Targaryen. Daario is one of the captains of the Stormcrows who attend the parley with Daenerys. She offers the captains gold and plunder if the Stormcrows come over to her side, but is rebuffed by Prendahl na Ghezn, one of the other captains. The Stormcrows are a company of freedmen, and therefore the question of breaking the contract with Yunkai would have to be put to each man. While that debate is going on in the camp, Daario, won over by Daenerys, kills Prendahl and his fellow captain, Sallor the Bald, and brings the Stormcrows over to Daenerys.</p>

						<h3>Who played the role?</h3>
						<p> Michiel Huisman</p>
						<p> Huisman was born on July 18, 1981 in Amstelveen, Noord-Holland, which is near Amsterdam. Before Game of Thrones (2011), Huisman had a role in Paul Verhoeven's acclaimed Black Book (2006), and he played Rudolf Nureyev in the BBC TV movie Margot (2009) about prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn. Before he became ubiquitous on television, Huisman also performed in a band called Fontaine that wrote music for soundtracks. (Huisman released a solo album in 2005.)

Huisman combined his acting and musical talents on the show Treme (2010), where he played Sonny, a drug addicted musician. Then came Huisman's big break into one of the hottest shows on cable, Game of Thrones (2011), where he took over the role of Daario Naharis. Huisman was given a lot of leeway to approach the character and re-interpret Daario his own way. The creators of Game of Thrones (2011) felt that viewers would adapt to the transition between actors well, and Huisman was indeed accepted by fans of the show.
