							<h2>Maester Aemon </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Aemon, born Aemon Targaryen, is the third son of King Maekar I Targaryen and his wife Dyanna Dayne. He has served as a maester to the Night's Watch at Castle Black for so long that the rest of the Seven Kingdoms has forgotten about his Targaryen blood.</p>
					<p> Aemon forged his chain, and earned the title of Maester Aemon, finishing his studies at the age of 19. He served an unidentified lord until his father, now King Maekar I, summoned him to court to serve the Iron Throne. Not wanting to sit on the small council as he felt that would displace the Grand Maester, Aemon chose instead to serve at Dragonstone, the seat of his eldest brother, Prince Daeron, until Daeron died of the pox. After Daeron's death, Maester Aemon became a maester at the Citadel. He was summoned to court for the Great Council of 233 AC, where some wanted to offer him the crown. Aemon quietly refused, however, ceding rule to his younger brother, Aegon V.Rhaelle, Aegon's young daughter, referred to Aemon as "Uncle Maester"
