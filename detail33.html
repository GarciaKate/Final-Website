							<h2>Lady Melisandre </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Melisandre is a red priestess of R'hllor and a shadowbinder, hailing from the city of Asshai in the Further East of Essos. She has joined the entourage of Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone, believing him to be Azor Ahai reborn, a hero destined to defeat the Great Other. She has become an influential advisor to him and his family.</p>
					<p> Melisandre is regarded as a beautiful woman by many. She has long hair the color of burnished copper and pale, unblemished skin. She is slender and graceful, and taller than most knights. She has full breasts, a narrow waist, and a heart-shaped face. She has a deep voice, with an eastern accent.</p>
					<p> As is the custom of the red priests of her faith, Melisandre always dresses in long robes of red fabric.She is never without a red gold choker containing a ruby which fits tightly around her neck. When Melisandre works magic, the ruby setting glows with power,and it may be able to burn her if the magic worked is particularly demanding.
