							<h2>Benjen Stark </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Benjen Stark, also known as Ben Stark, is the younger brother of Lord Eddard Stark and First Ranger of the Night's Watch.</p>
					<p> Benjen was the youngest child of Lord Rickard Stark and Lady Lyarra Stark. He attended the tourney at Harrenhal with his siblings, Brandon, Eddard, and Lyanna, in 281 AC. At the tournament Lyanna rescued their father's vassal, Howland Reed, from an attack by three squires. Benjen offered Howland a horse and some armor so he could challenge his attackers. During the feast held to celebrate the start of the tournament, he teased Lyanna when she cried for a sad and beautiful song by the noted musician, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Lyanna poured wine over his head for tesing him. When a black brother from the Night's Watch spoke up during the feast, attempting to convince the gathered people to join the black brothers,Benjen took the plea to heart.</p>
