							<h2>Rickon Stark </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Rickon is very young, he has bright eyes and favors his mother in appearance.After his mother traveled south Rickon refused to have his hair cut. As a result he has long, unruly hair. His youth makes it difficult for him to cope with the terrible changes that are brought upon his life and family by war, which are reflected in his direwolf companion named Shaggydog.</p>
					<p> Rickon adopts one of the direwolves found by the Starks and names it Shaggydog. After his father departs Winterfell and his mother lingers grief stricken at Bran's bedside, he follows Robb around, crying. When he learns that Robb is leaving too, he becomes very upset and is later found in the crypts of Winterfell, where he attacks two men with Shaggydog and an iron sword taken from one of the tombs. When Robb departs, he refuses to bid farewell. Shortly after Eddard's death in King's Landing, both Bran and Rickon share a vision of their father's spirit in the crypts.
