							<h2>Jorah Mormont </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Ser Jorah Mormont is an exiled knight, the former head of House Mormont and Lord of Bear Island. He fled Westeros to escape execution for trading in slaves and took up work as a mercenary in the Free Cities, eventually entering the service of the last Targaryens. He becomes one of the most trusted companions of Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
					<p> Jorah is a large middle-aged man, swarthy and very hairy. He is balding, but still strong and fit.[2][3] Daenerys Targaryen considers him not particularly handsome.[4] After being identified as a disobedient slave by his new owner, he has a demon face tattooed on his cheek, which, according to Tyrion Lannister, makes him look even more fearsome.</p>
