							<h2>Brienne of Tarth </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Brienne Tarth, commonly called Brienne of Tarth after her island home, is the only living child and heir of Selwyn Tarth, Lord of Evenfall and head of House Tarth. Brienne is sometimes called the Maid of Tarth and mocked as Brienne the Beauty.</p>
					<p> Brienne is unfeminine in appearance and is considered unattractive by Westerosi standards. She is tall, muscular, flat-chested, and ungainly, with straw-colored hair and broad, coarse features that are covered in freckles. Brienne's teeth are prominent and crooked. Her mouth is wide, her lips are swollen, and her nose has been broken more than once. She has large, beautiful blue eyes.</p>

						<h3>Who played the role?</h3>
						<p> Gwendoline Christie</p>
						<p> Gwendoline Christie was born in Worthing, West Sussex, England and trained in dance and gymnastics as a child. She graduated from Drama Centre London with a First Class BA (Hons) in 2005 and her first job was with Declan Donellan in 'Great Expectations' at the Royal Shakespeare Company that autumn. She then went on to work in regional theatre, world tours and the West End. Her striking appearance motivated photographer Polly Borland to collaborate with her as the subject of a noted series of photographs.

In 2011 Gwendoline was cast in the role of Brienne of Tarth in the successful HBO TV adaptation Game of Thrones (2011). She plays the role of Commander Lyme in the last two Hunger Games movies: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015). She has also been cast as Captain Phasma in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Absolutely Fabulous:The Movie (2016). Gwendoline is the face of the Vivienne Westwood A/W 2015 campaign.</p>					</div>
