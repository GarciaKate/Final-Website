							<h2>Mance Rayder </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Mance has a fondness for music, especially wildling songs. Some consider his voice passable and his playing fair. He also has a passion for free folk women.
Mance wears wool and leather, over which he drapes a slashed cloak of black wool and red silk from Asshai. He armors himself with black ringmail and shaggy fur breeches. Mance's helm is bronze and iron and has raven wings at each temple. Although recognized as King-Beyond-the-Wall, he does not wear a crown or carry a sceptre. Mance's great tent is made from the white pelts of snow bears and is topped with the antlers of a giant elk.

						<h3>Who played the role?</h3>
						<p> Ciaran Hinds</p>
						<p> Ciaran Hinds was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland on February 9, 1953. He was one of five children and the only son. His father was a doctor who hoped to have Ciaran follow in his footsteps, but that was not to be. It was his mother Moya, an amateur actress, who was the real influence behind his decision to become an actor. Though he did enroll in Law at Queens' University of Belfast, he left that in order to train in acting at RADA. He began his stage career at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre as a pantomime horse in the production of "Cinderella". Staying with the company for several years, he starred in a number of productions, including playing the lead roles in "Arsenic and Old Lace" and "Faust". His stage career has included working with The Field Day Company and a number of world tours. He has starred in a number of productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including a world tour in the title role of "Richard III". Hinds' film career began in 1981 in the movie Excalibur (1981), which boasted a cast rich in talented actors including Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne and Patrick Stewart. In-between his movie work, he's amassed a large number of television credits. Playing such classic characters as "Mr. Rochester" in Jane Eyre (1997), and "Captain Wentworth" in Screen Two: Persuasion (1995) has increased his popularity and most definitely given him much increased recognition. As for his personal life, you won't be likely to see his name in the weekly tabloids. He likes to keep his private life private. It is known that he is in a long-term, committed relationship with a French-Vietnamese actress named Hélène Patarot and they have a daughter together and live in Paris. He is in very high demand and his reputation as a quality, professional actor is sure to keep him busy for as long as he chooses.</p>					</div>
