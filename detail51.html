							<h2>Stannis Baratheon </h2>
						</header>
					<p>Stannis Baratheon is the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone and the Lord of Dragonstone. He is the secondborn son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, and Lady Cassana Estermont. He has an older brother, King Robert I Baratheon, and a younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon. </p>
					<p> Stannis is a serious, stubborn, rarely-forgiving, hard man with a strong sense of duty and justice.He grinds his teeth regularly. He is an accomplished commander, sailor, and warrior, with no thirst for battle, commanding from the rear.He has never had the affection of nobles and smallfolk alike. In his adult life, he is increasingly embittered by the lack of affection he receives from Robert, even though he serves Robert as well as he can.</p>
