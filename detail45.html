							<h2>Petyr Baelish </h2>

					<p> Petyr Baelish, also called Littlefinger, is the head of House Baelish of the Fingers. He serves as master of coin on King Robert I Baratheon's small council. Petyr wears a mockingbird as his personal crest instead of House Baelish's sigil, a titan's head.</p>
					<p> Petyr had always been cunning and clever. As a child, he was bold, always getting into trouble, but was also capable of looking contrite after his mischiefs. While Petyr was born to the small and insignificant House Baelish, he is a subtle and ambitious man, whose intelligence helped him advance in terms of power and status. He possesses considerable skill in commerce and coin, as well as manipulation, and has a gift for political improvisation. He is often underestimated by many high lords due to his low birth. According to George R. R. Martin, "Everybody trusts him because he seems powerless, and he's very friendly, and he's very helpful." Despite this, Tyrion Lannister considers Petyr to be a dangerous man.</p>
