							<h2>Daario Naharis </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Daario is part of the Stormcrows when they take on a contract to defend Yunkai from the forces of Daenerys Targaryen. Daario is one of the captains of the Stormcrows who attend the parley with Daenerys. She offers the captains gold and plunder if the Stormcrows come over to her side, but is rebuffed by Prendahl na Ghezn, one of the other captains. The Stormcrows are a company of freedmen, and therefore the question of breaking the contract with Yunkai would have to be put to each man. While that debate is going on in the camp, Daario, won over by Daenerys, kills Prendahl and his fellow captain, Sallor the Bald, and brings the Stormcrows over to Daenerys.</p>

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>

The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
