							<h2>Gregor Clegane </h2>
						</header>
					<p>Ser Gregor Clegane is the Knight of Clegane's Keep and is the head of House Clegane, landed knights and bannermen to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Gregor is a freakishly large man and for this he is often called the Mountain That Rides or simply the Mountain. His soldiers are known as the Mountain's men. </p>
					<p>In battle Gregor wears the heaviest, thickest plate armor in the Seven Kingdoms. His armor is so heavy that no ordinary man would be able to move, let alone fight effectively while wearing it, making him nigh-invincible in combat. Below the plate he wears chainmail and boiled leather. He also wears a plate helm with only a narrow slit for vision, atop of which is a stone fist punching up towards the sky. Gregor carries an extremely thick oaken shield bearing the three black dogs of House Clegane on a yellow field. </p>
