							<h2>Brienne of Tarth </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Brienne Tarth, commonly called Brienne of Tarth after her island home, is the only living child and heir of Selwyn Tarth, Lord of Evenfall and head of House Tarth. Brienne is sometimes called the Maid of Tarth and mocked as Brienne the Beauty.</p>
					<p> Brienne is unfeminine in appearance and is considered unattractive by Westerosi standards. She is tall, muscular, flat-chested, and ungainly, with straw-colored hair and broad, coarse features that are covered in freckles. Brienne's teeth are prominent and crooked. Her mouth is wide, her lips are swollen, and her nose has been broken more than once. She has large, beautiful blue eyes.</p>

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>
						<p>Game of Thrones is the immensely popular television show that has aired for six seasons on HBO, and will air Season 7 on July 16. The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
