							<h2>Jaime Lannister</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As young children, Jaime and his sister Cersei looked so much alike, that not even their father was able to keep them apart.Jaime grew into a tall, handsome man, with curled hair the color of beaten gold.He has flashing cat-green eyes, and a smile that cuts like a knife.Jon Snow thinks to himself that Jaime is "what a king should look like", and Bran Stark feels that Jaime looks like "more like the knights in the stories".
</p>
						<p>As a Kingsguard knight, Jaime wears a white armor and a white cloak.On occasion he wears golden armor decorated with the Lannister lion, with gilded longsword and ornate lion's helmet. He slew the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen while wearing his white cloak over his golden armor.Jaime alternatively wears a crimson silk tunic embroidered with a golden lion, along with black boots and a black cloak.He also wears crimson cloaks and a leather jack. Jaime wields a lance of golden wood.
</p>
						<p>Jaime is a born warrior, with little interest in politics and court intrigue. He takes few things seriously. By his own admission, Jaime only feels truly alive when fighting or making love.He comes across as arrogant, amoral, and dishonorable.Because of the death of King Aerys, Jaime has earned such a bad reputation that everything he says is usually cast in the worst possible light.Jaime is rash, headstrong, and angers quickly. He is known to have little patience,and worries about the consequences of his actions only after committing the act. A great warrior,Jaime inspires loyalty in his men.He is bold,and does not fear death.
