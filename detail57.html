							<h2>Robert Baratheon </h2>
						</header>
					<p> King Robert I Baratheon is the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the head of House Baratheon of King's Landing. Robert was crowned king after King Aerys II Targaryen, his first cousin once removed, was killed during Robert's Rebellion. Following the war, Robert married Cersei Lannister to ensure political stability. With her, Robert has three children: Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.</p>
					<p> Robert is brave, but headstrong, rash, and impatient. He is proud, and will not likely back down on words spoken in a drunken bravado.As king, Robert is no longer used to someone disagreeing with him, and a good way of ensuring that heâ€™d do something, is telling him that he could not, should not, of must not do something (especially in public).Tyrion Lannister considers Robert to be a great blustering oaf,while Varys describes him as a fool.Cersei Lannister considers Robert to be an ignorant,dumb,slow-witted,drunken brute of a man,who does not have the ruthless streak she believes a king requires.Although several people consider Robert to be brave, Cersei believes him to be a coward. According to Petyr Baelish, Robert is simply very practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.</p>
