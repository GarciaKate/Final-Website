							<h2>Gendry</h2>
						</header>
					<p> Gendry is a blacksmith apprentice for master Tobho Mott in King's Landing. When Gendry was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith; he does not know he is a bastard son of King Robert I.
Gendry was born in King's Landing, and does not know who his father was. His mother was a worker at an alehouse, who died when he was still a young boy. All he remembers of her was that she had blond hair. Tobho Mott, a master smith, took him on as an apprentice after being paid double the customary fee by a man who concealed his identity.It is possible that this man was Varys, using one of his disguises.
