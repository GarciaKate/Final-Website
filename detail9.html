							<h2>Tyrion Lannister</h2>
						</header>
					<p> In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life — even from his own family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit, and self-indulgence. But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is tasked by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing—as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king—as civil war is sparked. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey — including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost, and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger, but without his Lannister resources.

						<h3>Who played the role?</h3>
						<p> Peter Dinklage</p>
						<p> Peter Hayden Dinklage was born in Morristown, New Jersey, to Diane (Hayden), an elementary school teacher, and John Carl Dinklage, an insurance salesman. He is of German, Irish, and English descent. In 1991, he received a degree in drama from Bennington College and began his career. His exquisite theatre work that expresses brilliantly the unique range of his acting qualities, includes remarkable performances full of profoundness, charisma, intelligence, sensation and insights in plays such as "The Killing Act", "Imperfect Love", Ivan Turgenev's "A Month in the Country" as well as the title roles in William Shakespeare's "Richard III" and in Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya".

Peter Dinklage received acclaim for his first film, Living in Oblivion (1995), where he played an actor frustrated with the limited and caricatured roles offered to actors who have dwarfism. In 2003, he starred in The Station Agent (2003), written and directed by Tom McCarthy. The movie received critical praise and Peter was nominated for best actor at the "Screen Actors Guild" and "Independent Spirit Awards".

The original English Death at a Funeral (2007), its American remake Death at a Funeral (2010), Penelope (2006) and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) are a few more of his feature films.

He also had recurring appearances in television shows such as HBO's Entourage (2004) and ABC's Life As We Know It (2004). He played a larger role in the critically-acclaimed, yet short-lived CBS show, Threshold (2005). In 2011, he landed a primary role, as "Tyrion Lannister", on the HBO series, Game of Thrones (2011). Tyrion's wit made him a favorite character on the series.
