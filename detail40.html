							<h2>Hodor</h2>
						</header>
					<p> Hodor is large and slow of wits, but is gentle and loyal to the Stark family. He is only capable of saying one word, Hodor. The Stark children believed this to be his name, until enlightened by Old Nan, his great-grandmother, that his real name is Walder.</p>
					<p> Hodor is over seven feet tall, with brown eyes and a brown beard.It is been suggested by Osha that his large size is a result of giants' blood.</p>
					<p>After Bran Stark's fall, he needs a way to move about the castle. Maester Luwin designs a basket that can be strapped to Hodor's back and in which Bran can be placed. Hodor has served as Bran's way of transportation since. However, Hodor, being a simpleton, sometimes forgets that Bran is in the basket, which causes Bran moments of pain. </p>
