							<h2>Tyrion Lannister</h2>
						</header>
					<p> In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life — even from his own family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit, and self-indulgence. But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is tasked by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing—as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king—as civil war is sparked. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey — including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost, and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger, but without his Lannister resources.

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>

The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
