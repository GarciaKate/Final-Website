							<h2>Tyene Sand</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Tyene is regarded as treacherous, while maintaining a sweet and pious persona. Areo Hotah thinks Tyene looks as sweet as summer strawberries. She is fair, with golden hair, blue eyes and an almost otherworldly innocence about her.[2] She has soft pale hands but they are as deadly as Obara's callused ones, if not more so. She shares her father's knowledge of poisons and it is her chosen weapon.
