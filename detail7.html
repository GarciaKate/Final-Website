							<h2>Catelyn Stark</h2>
						</header>
						<p>She is described as beautiful, with auburn hair, blue eyes, and long fingers, and dressed simply in the grey of House Stark or the blue and red of her fatherâ€™s household. Catelyn is proud, strong, kind, and generous, and has a strong grasp of politics. She is often governed by the desire to protect her children. She is most often in accord with her husband Eddard Stark, but resents his admission of his illegitimate son Jon Snow into their household.

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>
						<p>Game of Thrones is the immensely popular television show that has aired for six seasons on HBO, and will air Season 7 on July 16. The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
