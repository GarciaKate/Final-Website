							<h2>Joffrey Baratheon</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Joffrey has the Lannister look and is tall for a boy his age, with blond curly hair. Known to be handsome, he has bright green eyes, pouty lips and an evil sneer. Jon Snow thinks that Joffrey looks like a girl. He always wears the finest clothing and accents, as befits the royal heir. His surcout is divided, showing both the Baratheon stag of his father, King Robert I, and the Lannister lion of his mother, Cersei.Joffrey is a skilled dancer.
</p>
						<p>Twelve years old at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire, Joffrey was strong-willed as a child and has an uncontrollable temper not unlike Cersei and an unchecked sadistic streak. He has little sense of right or wrong, which often leads him to trouble, especially when he loses his temper. When things go wrong, he always blames the problems on others. Despite being willful he is reckless, vicious, cruel and not very intelligent, all of which combine to make him prone to irrational and bad judgements.

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>
