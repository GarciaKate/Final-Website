							<h2>Osha</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Osha is a free folk woman who becomes a captive of Winterfell and later a servant of House Stark.
Osha travels with three other wildlings and a pair of Night's Watch deserters, Stiv and Wallen. This group flees south of the Wall, trying to escape the Others. They cross the Wall and travel into the wolfswood north of Winterfell, where they come upon the crippled Bran Stark. Osha wants to take him hostage and return to Mance Rayder, presumably to use him to gain passage south through the Wall. Robb Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Grey Wind, and Summer arrive to rescue him and all of the band are killed, except Osha. She is taken back to Winterfell for questioning.She is eventually given a limited freedom of the castle for her good behavior and employed as a kitchen servant.
