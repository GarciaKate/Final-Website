							<h2>Arya Stark</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. She has four siblings: an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers Bran and Rickon, and an older sister, Sansa. She grew up with Jon Snow, whom she assumed was her illegitimate half-brother although he is actually her cousin. Arya is the only character with point-of-view chapters in every published book of the series.
</p>
						<p>Arya Stark is the youngest daughter and third child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Eddard was the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell and Eddard also holds the title Lord of Winterfell. He is also the Warden of the North to King Robert Baratheon.
Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older sister, Sansa Stark. She also has an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers, Bran and Rickon and a "bastard half-brother", Jon Snow.
Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power, instead she believes she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her "half-brother" Jon, who is also something of an outcast.</p>
