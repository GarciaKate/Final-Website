							<h2>Daenarys Targaryen</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Daenerys Targaryen is one of the only two surviving heirs to House Targaryen, which once ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros before Robert Baratheon deposed Daenerysâ€™s father, King Aerys II Targaryen. When Game of Thrones begins, Daenerys and Viserys, her older brother, live as exiles on the continent of Essos, across the Narrow Sea. Viserys is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, and in an attempt to gain an army to retake the throne, he sells Daenerys to the Dothraki tribal leader, Khol Drogo, when she is only 15 years old. At first, Daenerys is timid and submissive, doing what her brother says. However, after marrying Drogo, falling in love with him, and finding her place among the Dothraki people, Daenerys begins to find her inner strength to stand up to her brother.</p>
