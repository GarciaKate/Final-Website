							<h2>Meera Reed </h2>
						</header>
					<p> Meera has been taught by her father to fight with a net and a three pronged frog spear. She is a fine hunter, able to easily spear fish. She was able to defeat Summer in mock combat with her weapons by entangling the direwolf in her net.</p>
					<p> Meera is described as having a cheerful disposition, in stark contrast to her sullen brother. She is intensely loyal and protective of her "prince" as well as her own brother, and will not back down from a fight if need be. Bran says that the only thing that ever makes her angry or upset is her brother Jojen.</p>

						<h3>What is Game of Thrones all about?</h3>
						<p>Game of Thrones is the immensely popular television show that has aired for six seasons on HBO, and will air Season 7 on July 16. The show is based on the epic fantasy novel series, A Song of Fire and Ice, written by George R. R. Martin. The first novel of the seven-book series is called A Game of Thrones; the show creators and HBO decided to keep that title as the overall name of the show. </p>
