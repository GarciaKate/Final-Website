							<h2>Lancel Lannister </h2>
						</header>
					<p>Lancel Lannister is a member of House Lannister of Casterly Rock and the eldest son of Ser Kevan Lannister. Lancel and his cousin, Tyrek Lannister, are squires to King Robert I Baratheon. </p>
					<p>A young, strong, handsome blond-haired youth, Lancel is said to closely resemble his cousin, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard. He has green eyes and sandy hair. Lancel is humorless, self-assured, arrogant, and impatient. </p>
					<p>Lancel, the head of House Lannister of Darry, reluctantly takes his lordship of the lands of Darry and is ambivalent as to rumors of his new wife's promiscuity. Ser Jaime Lannister visits Lancel at Darry and, under questioning, Lancel admits to having slept with Cersei as well as to having supplied Robert I Baratheon with the strongwine. Shortly afterwards, Lancel leaves his wife and castle in order to swear service as part of the newly-reformed Faith Militant. He is seen having joined the Warrior's Sons, a division of highborn knights devoted to the Seven. Under the command of Ser Theodan the True, he makes up part of Cersei's escort in her walk of atonement. </p>
