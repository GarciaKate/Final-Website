							<h2>High Sparrow</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The High Sparrow arrives in King's Landing after Tywin Lannister's death to serve the poor, downtrodden, and infirm. He quickly amassed a large following, including Cersei Lannister's cousin and former lover Lancel, who are dubbed the "sparrows". He comes to the attention of Cersei after Lancel and the other sparrows force the High Septon to walk naked through the streets as punishment for soliciting prostitutes. The High Septon demands the High Sparrow's execution, but Cersei instead has the High Septon imprisoned and the High Sparrow appointed as his successor. To further gain his support, Cersei also reinstates the Faith Militant. Hoping to destabilise House Tyrell, Cersei arranges for the Faith Militant to arrest Loras Tyrell for being homosexual, with Margaery also arrested when she lies in an attempt to exonerate him. However, Lancel confesses to his affair with Cersei, as well as their role in Robert Baratheon's death. Cersei is subsequently arrested when she visits the Great Sept of Baelor. She eventually confesses to her adultery with Lancel to secure her release, and is ordered to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing as punishment.
</p>
						<p> The High Sparrow is confronted by Jaime Lannister, who is furious at Cersei's treatment at his hands, though Jaime is forced to stand down when the Faith Militant surround him. When Tommen begins visiting the High Sparrow to negotiate visits with Margaery, he begins to fall under the High Sparrow's influence. Jaime marches on the Great Sept with the Tyrell army to secure Margaery and Loras' release, but is thwarted when Tommen reveals that he has formed an alliance between the Crown and the Faith. The High Sparrow's thrall over Tommen leads him to abolish trial by combat, thwarting Cersei's hopes of being absolved by that means.

						<h3>Who played the role?</h3>
						<p> Jonathan Pryce</p>
						<p> From Holywell to Hollywood, Jonathan Pryce, CBE is a critically acclaimed and award winning actor from North Wales, internationally regarded as the one of greatest ones both on stage and screen. Renowned for his immense versatility and powerful presence he has transcended the industry, effortlessly moving between Hollywood studio films and the classical West End in a range of work that also includes bold independent cinema and the Broadway musical. He has created some of the most memorable characters in cinema and for over forty years been on the wish list of many of the worlds most notorious and accomplished directors as 'Someone they must work with'. Jonathan, after graduating from the world famous RADA in London, began his career in the 1970's at the hugely influential Liverpool Everyman Theatre which grounded his politics and talent and helped attract a legacy of brave individual artists that have since been through their doors. From his definitive performance as Hamlet, he made his breakthrough screen performance in Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil (1985). The phrase an 'Actors Actor' is often overused but with Jonathan Pryce I can think of no better fitting tribute because what that means to the industry is - here is a talent people want to watch and people want to work with. His choices can be considered as bold as they should be as well as always truthful that give life to characters multi-layered and always exciting, where it can be even hard to believe that he is just one man.

As in his stage course that includes notable performances such as in "Hamlet", "The Merchant of Venice", "The Goat or Who is Sylvia?", "The Taming of the Shrew", "Miss Saigon", "Oliver", "Comedians" and "King Lear", Jonathan Pryce's range of staggering portrayals full of generously euphoric delight has also been expressed in films such as Brazil (1985), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), The Age of Innocence (1993), Carrington (1995), Evita (1996), Behind the Lines (1997), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Very Annie Mary (2001), Unconditional Love (2002) and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) as well as in mesmerizing TV roles such as in Roger Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1981), Game of Thrones (2011), My Zinc Bed (2008), Wolf Hall (2015) and Taboo (2017).</p>
