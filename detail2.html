							<h2>Jon Snow</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Jon Snow was raised among Lord Eddard's own children he has an older half brother named Robb, two younger half sisters named Sansa and Arya, and two younger half brothers named Bran and Rickon. When he was an infant Eddard brought him back from the war much to the distress of his wife Catelyn who had just gave birth to Robb during the time. Jon was also educated by master Luwin along with the other stark children and taught swordsmanship by ser Rodrik Cassel and Excelled at it. As he got older He and Robb became rivals in training and the two of them continued to bond over it. during one of their practice fights the two of them called out the names of great warriors and Jon said countless times before that "I am the lord of Winterfell" which lead to Robb saying he could never be the lord of Winterfell which later became a sore memory for Jon.</p>
